# 8. Twenty-seven things that will surprise you, all measured

Load it when something the fit did makes no sense. Every entry is a measured result that contradicts an intuition.

*A reference file of the `rietx` skill. The body it belongs to is [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md); section numbers are the ones the body cites.*

These are the findings from building the package that change how an agent
should behave. Each one cost a debugging pass.

**8.1 A correction that provably cannot improve Rwp can still be essential.**
The capillary absorption factor factors *exactly* into a constant × exp(c·sin²θ)
— a Debye-Waller shape — so applying it to a model with a free scale and free
Biso leaves the residual unchanged to machine precision. Its entire content is
that a Biso refined without it comes back **low by 0.49 Å² at µR = 1** (Cu Kα),
which is comparable to Biso itself and 19σ against its own esd. `result.absorption`
reports the bias because no fit statistic can. **Corollary for the agent: never
judge a correction by Δ Rwp. Ask which physical quantity it unbiases.**

Measured end to end on a real capillary pattern (11-BM, NIST SRM 660a LaB₆ in
the documented 0.81 mm bore, µR = 0.674): Rwp moved 3 × 10⁻⁸, the lattice
parameter 8 × 10⁻¹² Å, and **both** displacement parameters moved by
+0.0166542 Å² against a predicted 0.0166542. That is what "exact" means here.
It is not a general property of absorption corrections — see 8.12.

`rietx compare` is this rule made mechanical: a browser UI comparing refinement
settings side by side on the bundled standards, whose cumulative-Δχ² panel shows
*where* a correction acted rather than whether Rwp moved.

**8.2 The opposite also happens: an improvement that passes every statistical
test and is still rejected.** On round-robin brucite, adding anisotropic strain
improves Rwp 18.55 → 17.90 % with ΔBIC +15.5 at N/f² — and drives σ²(M) negative on 12
of 43 reflections, so the coefficients are unphysical and unquotable. A
statistical test cannot see a violated positivity cone.

**8.3 Judge a correction at the reflections, not on the fitted grid.** The IUCr
round-robin patterns start at 5° 2θ but their first reflections are at 25–32°.
A grid-based fence cheerfully reported a 27 % low-angle intensity depression
that no modelled peak ever experienced. If you are reasoning about where a
correction has leverage, the relevant coordinate is *where the reflections are*.

**8.4 A multiplicative correction is trivially ~0.96 "scale-like".** Any
correction that rescales intensity projects almost entirely onto the scale
column, so a raw R² against a block containing the scale is a constant that
says nothing. Use the **partial** R² with the scale and background projected
out first — `optimize.statistics.block_projection_r2(..., nuisance=...)`. With
that fix the statistic tracks real identifiability (R² 0.06 → 0.95 as the
low-angle reflections leave the fitted range); without it, it saturates and the
guard is blind.

**8.5 Pairwise correlation is the wrong statistic for a block.** With ~100
spline coefficients, each individual |ρ| against a structural parameter stays
around 0.2 while the block collectively absorbs ~46 % of it. Ask "can this
*group*, acting together, imitate that one?" — that is what
`background_absorption` measures.

**8.6 Some parameters are dead at zero and some explode there.** A
softplus-transformed coefficient (extinction, roughness strength) has
dp/du → 0 at the floor, so it will never move: it needs `Stage.seed`. A
Stephens block has Λ ∝ √Σ with *unbounded* slope at Σ = 0, so it needs
`Stage.strain_seed` to start on the isotropic ray instead. These are opposite
pathologies with opposite fixes; the plans already carry both.

**8.7 A default is a decision, in either direction.** Anisotropic ADPs,
Stephens strain, surface roughness and preferred orientation are opt-in per
atom/phase, because each needs a number about *this* specimen that the file
does not carry. Anomalous dispersion is the exception and is **on by default
since v1.0**: it needs only the species and the wavelength, both already in the
model, so declining it is the choice that has to be justified. Turning any of
them on or off changes every number downstream, including published acceptance
values — if you change one, re-measure; do not carry a comparison across the
change. Note the two knock-on effects WP-1001 measured when dispersion went to
the default: on a specimen sitting inside an absorption-edge interval the
lookup **raises** rather than degrading (that is deliberate — a selective
fallback would leave some species corrected and others not, manufacturing
exactly the unequal cross-phase bias the correction exists to remove; decline
the block or supply `overrides`), and light-atom ADPs come back *less precise*
even as they come back *less biased* (rutile U11/U33 separate at 1.9σ with the
block on against 2.2σ without, because f″ raises the heavy atom's share).

**8.8 Never transfer a literature constant without a numerical check across
*all* its arguments.** A published cylinder-absorption coefficient printed as
"−0·0375" is really −0·3750; the error is invisible against a constant-θ slice
of the paper's own table (which constrains only the other two coefficients) and
is 0.082 wrong at µR = 1. What caught it was a quadrature of the exact integral
the fit approximates — which shares no constant with any published fit. The
general rule: **the strongest anchor is the integral a fit approximates, not
another code's transcription of the same fit.** The same applies to Stephens
S_HKL, where codes fold symmetry multiplicities into their templates and print
values differing by small integer factors.

**8.9 An absurd statistic is more often the linear algebra than the physics.**
JᵀJ here is routinely conditioned at ~10²⁰ — that is what the degeneracy table
in §3 *means* numerically. Until 2026-07-28 the covariance was taken with
`np.linalg.pinv`'s general SVD path, which does not know the matrix is
symmetric and returned correlations as large as |ρ| ≈ 1.6 × 10³ (and +2.75 for
`scale ~ axial_sl` on a real fluorite fit). If a reported correlation, esd or
weight-fraction uncertainty is impossible rather than merely surprising, check
the conditioning before you invent a physical story for it — and remember that
the fix is to compute the covariance properly, not to clip the output, because
clipping 2.75 to 1.0 reports a degeneracy the arithmetic invented rather than
the one the data has.

**8.10 Conventions are documented by physics, never by letter.** GSAS and
FullProf swap the X/Y size/strain labels. Most tabulations print the absorption
*correction* A\* = 1/A where this package multiplies by the *transmission*
A ≤ 1 — and both equal 1 at µR = 0, so an identity test cannot tell them apart;
only the direction of the θ-dependence can. The March coefficient r means
opposite habits in reflection and transmission geometry. **Read the docstring,
not the symbol.**

**8.11 The anode is a physics choice, not a number to look up.** All six
`radiation=` presets come from one column of one evaluation (NIST XRTE
SRD 128), and the shipped `CuKa` pair is bit-identical to it — that is what
makes the others trustworthy, so **never substitute a value from elsewhere**;
Bearden's widely-quoted numbers are a different scale, 24–26 ppm away at Mo/Ag.
Three things then follow from *which* anode, all measured:

* The Kα1/Kα2 gap grows from 20 eV at Cu to 173 eV at Ag, so the one-|F|²-per-
  source assumption gets weaker. A census over Z = 3–98 × six anodes refuses 7
  of 576 combinations, and one is a real specimen: **Ru at Ag Kα**, K edge
  22.14 keV, between the lines. The refusal is correct — split the lines into
  separate histograms or supply a measured override.
* What `DISPERSION_NEGLECTED` is warning about is anode-dependent: hematite is
  a `warning` at Co Kα (180 eV under the Fe K edge, f′ = −3.3 e) and an `info`
  at Mo Ka (f′ = +0.3 e). Same specimen, same code, different severity.
* Contamination checks are per anode. An unrecognised wavelength (synchrotron,
  an untabulated anode) yields `contamination == []` — *not checked*, not
  clean. `background.identify_anode(λ)` returns `None` there and is how you
  tell the two apart.

**8.12 "Infinitely thick" is a modelling claim you make by saying nothing.**
Every flat-plate fit in this package — and by default in every Rietveld code —
assumes the specimen is thicker than the beam penetrates. That is exactly right
for a filled well and badly wrong for a thin layer on a zero-background holder,
which is how small, precious or air-sensitive samples are usually mounted. The
error is much larger than the capillary case and has the opposite sign:
`ΔBiso = −1.5 Å² at µt = 0.2` over a Cu Kα range, because a thin specimen runs
out of material exactly where the beam penetrates deepest, and the missing
high-angle intensity reads as thermal motion.

Four consequences for an agent:

* Declare `Geometry.mu_t` (or `thickness_mm`, and let it be estimated) whenever
  the specimen is a thin mount. Silence means thick.
* The "off" value is **µt = ∞, not 0** — the reverse of every other correction
  here. `mu_t = 0` is a specimen of no thickness and is refused for reflection
  geometry rather than being taken as "no correction". Under
  `flat_plate_transmission` it is the other way round: silence means a
  transparent plate, and the sec θ footprint factor applies regardless, because
  it belongs to the tilt rather than to the absorption.
* **The reported ΔBiso is a lower bound here, not the answer.** For the
  capillary it is exact (seven decimals on real data); for a flat plate the
  bias a fit actually absorbs runs 1.06–1.5× larger, tracking
  `absorption.unabsorbed_fraction` — which is on the record for exactly this
  reason. Quote it as "at least this much", with the residue beside it.
* Unlike the capillary case this one **does** move Rwp, because it is not an
  exact reparameterisation (1–40 % of ln A survives a free scale and Biso). So
  8.1's rule inverts: here a *worse* Rwp after declaring a thickness is
  evidence the specimen was not that thin. Measured on round-robin fluorite —
  a thick back-packed mount — declaring µt = 0.5 takes Rwp 0.1793 → 0.1830 and
  drives one Biso onto its bound. That is the correction correctly refusing to
  fit a specimen that is not there.

**8.13 A stage that takes minutes is telling you it is degenerate.** Measured
on three weighed NaCl/Li₂CO₃ mixtures — identical models, identical parameter
counts, same-sized patterns — wall clock ran **39 s, 858 s and 2 838 s**, a 73×
spread with no corresponding difference in the answer, and the pass reported
`status="converged"` either way. Until v1.1 the budget made that spread far
worse than it needed to be: `max_nfev` was `max_iter × n_par`, pricing a
finite-difference Jacobian the package does not build, so at 46 free parameters
a single `max_iter=100` stage could spend **4 600** evaluations before giving
up. It is now `max_iter ×` a small measured constant (the worst
evaluations-per-iteration ratio over 28 real stages is 3.2), so a stalling
stage says so roughly 30× sooner and a converging one is untouched — every
protocol measured stops an order of magnitude inside the cap. That changes when
you hear about it, not what you should do about it. The
stages that stall are the degenerate groups of §3, so the signal is available
*before* you run them: per-phase size/strain freed against a still-free
instrument U,V,W,X,Y (they model one width curve; the package's own
`lab_sample_refine` only frees them against a **frozen** calibrated instrument),
or preferred orientation whose coefficient has reached a bound. **Corollary:
treat elapsed time as a diagnostic. If a stage runs long, do not wait for it —
look at what you freed.**

**8.14 A bound that exists is not a bound that holds.**
`PreferredOrientation.r` is declared `min=0.0` with a softplus transform, the
idiom that is supposed to keep a parameter strictly positive. The softplus
pre-image runs to −∞, so `r` reaches **exactly 0**, and the March-Dollase factor
then evaluates `(1 − c)/r` and returns inf/NaN. Nothing raises: the residual
becomes garbage and the trust region grinds through its whole budget on it (a
3-second stage that had not returned after ten minutes). Bounding `r` to
0.15–6 fixed the stall *and* the fit, Rwp 30.8 % → 13.2 %. **Corollary: for any
parameter whose model divides by it, set a real floor rather than trusting the
transform — and read `RuntimeWarning: divide by zero` as a fit-stopping error,
not noise.**

**8.15 A coverage score cannot tell a mixture from a low-symmetry single phase,
and this project already published that mistake and withdrew it.** Measured on
third-party data with an engine restricted to two metric parameters: it indexed
47–60 % of the lines of *single-phase* orthorhombic and monoclinic patterns,
82–100 % of genuinely tetragonal or hexagonal ones, and 69 % of a real
two-phase mixture. **The bands overlap.** A "this pattern contains at least two
phases" claim built on the 69 % had to be retracted, because the same number is
what a single-phase pattern of symmetry the engine could not reach produces.
`IndexingResult` therefore carries `systems_searched` beside `search_complete`
and reports failure as *"no cell found in the systems searched"*; no diagnostic
code in the indexing vocabulary asserts a phase count at all, and a test pins
that. **Corollary: partial coverage is a statement about your search, not about
the specimen. Widen the systems before you conclude anything about the sample.**

**8.16 An indexer's tolerance is not its precision, and the gap is 11σ on real
data.** The peak list carries a *fitted* σ(2θ) per line — median 0.0056° on the
bundled corundum pattern, whose cell is certified — and that σ is exactly right
for **weighting** and exactly wrong as a **matching window**: the same pattern's
lines sit a median 0.060° from the certified positions, a cos θ specimen
displacement of −0.065°. At 3σ the true cell indexes *zero* lines and both
engines return nothing, on a pattern whose answer is known. That is why every
indexing program in the literature ships a global ~0.03° tolerance, and why the
engines here add an assumed 0.05° in quadrature and say so with
`INDEX_SHIFT_ALLOWANCE`. **Corollary for the agent: a cell found under a widened
window has absorbed the shift (+1400 ppm measured), so re-fit it with
`shift_template` before quoting it — and the way to earn `high` confidence is to
supply a measured `shift_allowance_deg` — the shift's amplitude, not the
residual scatter a template leaves — from an internal standard, not to widen
further.**

**8.17 "Is there intensity here?" is not one question — it depends on what else
your hypothesis predicts nearby.** Two detectors in this package ask it with the
same window (±½ FWHM) and the same threshold (3σ), and they must use different
null models. WP-1024's `predicted_but_absent` asks it against the fitted
**background**, which is right for an oversized cell's phantom reflection because
a phantom sits in a *gap*. WP-1025's extinction screen asks it at a **forbidden**
position, which sits inside a dense predicted pattern — and measured on the FAP
lab pattern, the 003 that P 6₃/m forbids is 0.89 FWHM from an allowed neighbour
ten times stronger whose tail fills the window to **+27.6 σ**. Against the class's
own `y_calc` — background plus every reflection the class still allows — the same
window reads **−3.9 σ**. **Corollary for the agent: never compute your own
"nothing is here" test from the raw pattern minus a background.** Where nothing
else is predicted nearby the two agree; where something is, the raw test refutes
the true answer.

**8.18 A position correction belongs to a geometry, and the suggestion you get
now says which.** `cos θ` is the *flat-plate* specimen-displacement shape, and
`instrument.geometry.sample_displacement` is force-fixed on anything that is not
`bragg_brentano`. A capillary off the centre of the 2θ circle has its own pair
(McCusker eq 4): `instrument.geometry.capillary_offset_along_beam` carries sin 2θ
and `…_across_beam` carries cos 2θ, they exist only on `debye_scherrer`, and both
need `goniometer_radius_mm`, which eq (4) divides by — a value or a `vary` without
one is refused by name rather than defaulted. Free them for a laboratory capillary
or Guinier camera; at a synchrotron with a crystal analyser the paper says the
displacement error is eliminated, and measured on 11-BM NAC the fit agrees, so
freeing them there measures nothing.

The report's position templates and actions are now chosen by geometry, so the
two `refine_sample_*` actions no longer reach a capillary fit at all (before
WP-1073 they did, naming parameters that could not be freed). On
`flat_plate_transmission` they do not reach either (WP-1003): that geometry
models neither aberration, so a `cos_theta` or `sin_2theta` trend there is
reported as a shape with no action — read it as "a flat specimen off the
axis", evidence with no legal one-click repair. **And this is a
correction whose cause the endpoint hides**: measured on a synthetic capillary
with a 0.30/−0.20 mm offset, refusing the pair puts −290 ppm into `a`, and the
converged report names *no* position cause, because the zero shift and the cell
between them imitate most of eq (4). The `zero` stage's own rung names
`refine_capillary_offset_along_beam` at 0.66. **Corollary for the agent: this is
§9's rule with a concrete case — read the trajectory, not the last state.**

**8.19 A restraint's weight is a per-stage decision, and a fit can converge to
an impossible bond without saying so.** `Stage.restraint_weight_scale` is c_w of
McCusker eq (7), S = S_y + c_w·S_G: high while the structure is incomplete or
approximate, reduced as it improves. It defaults to 1.0 (every restraint exactly
as declared), and 0.0 silences the restraints for a stage while keeping their
rows, so the row count the statistics exclude never changes mid-plan.

Measured on a synthetic case whose data under-determines two oxygen sites,
starting from a Zr–O of 3.73 Å for a 1.87 Å bond: the same three stages run at
c_w = 1 throughout converge with that distance at **4.834 Å**, the restraint
148σ in tension and the coordinates 0.425 rms from truth; run at c_w = 300 then
1, the stiff stage lands the bond at 1.866 Å (0.03σ) and the relaxed stage
converges at 1.872 Å, 0.00107 rms. The plans differ in nothing but c_w.

**Corollary for the agent: this is a case where the fit statistics are the
weaker channel and you must read `result.restraints`.** The failed fit's Rwp is
0.0393 against 0.0327 and its GoF 1.23 against 1.02 — a slightly worse fit, not
an announcement of a 4.8 Å bond; `RESTRAINT_TENSION` is what fires. And a stiff
c_w makes a restraint more authoritative, not more correct: where the assumed
coordination is wrong, §8 of the paper says the refinement "will not progress
satisfactorily", and raising c_w makes that worse rather than better.
`RestraintReport.weight_scale` records which value produced a report, so the
penalty actually minimised is `weight_scale · restraint_chi2`.

**8.20 Intermediate stages are not converged, on purpose, and the last one is.**
A staged plan stops every stage but the last at `ftol = 1e-6` rather than the
solver's `1e-9` (`RefinementPlan.intermediate_ftol`, default since 1.1). The
reason is 8.13's mechanism seen from the other side: those long stages are
walking a near-degenerate direction at ≈0.93 per iteration, and 99.99 % of the
cost decrease is banked by evaluation 55 of 93 — the rest is digits the next
stage refines again anyway, because stages are cumulative and the last one
polishes everything at `1e-9`. Measured over the three lab-shaped benchmark
cases: 1.51×, 1.62× and 1.55× fewer evaluations, every non-degenerate parameter
within 0.03 esd of the fully converged plan, QPA within 0.0014 wt %.
**Corollary for the agent, in three parts.** Do not read a small parameter
difference between a 1.0.x number and a 1.1 number as a physics change; check
`StageResult.ftol` first. Set `intermediate_ftol = None` when a number is going
into a paper, or when you are reproducing an earlier release, and say that you
did. And **measure a series rather than assuming it**: the same chained
ten-pattern comparison came out 1.04× *worse* on one tree and 1.12× *better* on
the next, one commit apart, because each pattern warm-starts from its
predecessor and a different seed changes how many recovery rungs the next one
needs (§9b). The per-fit bound above does not survive a chain in either
direction.

**8.21 A model-selection test can bless a change that makes half your phases
stop being measurements.** On a four-phase in-situ scan, the majority phase's
lines were visibly mis-shaped and the cause was real: its control file modelled
hkl-dependent strain and the transcription had dropped it. Freeing the
equivalent Stephens block (six Laue-allowed coefficients under `Pmn21`) took Rwp
0.1092 → 0.0878 and χ² 8460 → 5465 for **+4 net free parameters** at 3887
channels — ΔBIC −2962, so the test §4 prescribes endorses it overwhelmingly —
and removed 79-82 % of the two worst regions' χ². It also made
`PHASE_UNCONSTRAINED` fire on **two of the four phases**, which were supported
without it: six hkl-dependent coefficients on the majority phase are enough to
imitate the minority phases' lines, and `StageResult.held` grew from five paths
to twelve. The better fit is the one where half the answers stopped being
measurements. **Corollary for the agent: ΔBIC counts parameters, not whether
each phase still has support. After any Rwp gain from a new width or shape
model, re-read `PHASE_UNCONSTRAINED` and `StageResult.held` before quoting a
single scale, fraction or cell from the improved fit.**

The same run refutes a tempting converse. That width error owned **35 % of the
fit's χ²**, and correcting it moved the background level by **≤ 2 %** in every
region. A phase width and the background can be degenerate — a phase broadened
past the instrument becomes a second background — but they are not
*automatically* coupled: a width wrong enough to dominate the residual can leave
the background where it was. So do not read a width finding as a background
finding, or the reverse, without measuring. `BACKGROUND_ABSORPTION` on the
majority phase's scale was likewise unmoved, 0.442 before and 0.437 after, which
is the useful half: it measures the geometry of the problem, not the current
misfit, so it fires from a good start at the same value it fires at from a bad
one.

**8.22 A tie carries its dependent's bounds back onto its source, so a source
can stop somewhere it never declared.** The least-squares box covers the *free*
column, and a tied parameter is not one — it is reconstructed from its source
after the solve — so a dependent's own limits have to reach the solver through
the tie or not at all. They do: `dependent = coefficient · source + offset`
inverts to a range on the source, intersected over every dependent that source
drives and with whatever the source declares itself. `Atom.biso` is `[0, 25] Å²`,
so under `ref.tie("phases.0.atoms.2.biso", "phases.0.atoms.0.biso", scale=2.0)`
the master is given a ceiling of **12.5** whatever its own `max` says, and
`BOUND_HIT` names the master when a stage stops there. Measured: master 0.66 and
dependent 0.33 under a declared dependent ceiling of 0.33 at coefficient 0.5,
Rwp 0.0458 — a converged fit that stopped at a derived limit, not a failed one.
(Measured: WP-1119, four-site LaB6.)

**What this means when you read a run.** A `BOUND_HIT` on a source whose own
`min`/`max` are nowhere near the value is not a bug and not a bad bound — it is
one of its dependents' ceilings arriving through the tie, and the fix is to widen
*that* parameter, not the one the diagnostic names. Check the coefficients before
touching anything.

**One case it cannot close.** A tie with *several* sources is a slanted boundary,
and the optimiser can only be handed a range, so what it gets is the smallest
range containing every allowed point — it never rules out an answer you asked
for, and it can leave a corner where two sources conspire to put a dependent out
of range. Landing there raises on write-back, after the solve, naming the
parameter, its bounds and the tie: *"writing phases.0.atoms.1.biso=40 back to
the model breaks its own bounds [0, 25]; it follows 2·phases.0.atoms.0.biso"*.
Read that as a constraint to widen, never as a corrupt model or a bad CIF.
(Measured: WP-1119.)


**8.23 Declaring an intruding peak is not more *accurate* than excluding the
region — it is cheaper, and on some patterns that is the whole difference.**
A sample holder line sitting on a sample peak can be handled two ways: declare a
`PeakComponent` so the channels stay in the fit, or put the region in
`excluded_regions`. On the NIST SRM 660c LaB6 protocol with two holder lines
injected onto reflections, both recover the clean-pattern cell — declaring to
−1.0 ppm, excluding to +0.6 ppm — while *ignoring* the intruder costs +7.6 ppm
and inflates the cell esd 7.5x. Excluding cost 256 of 5332 channels (4.8 %).
**So do not tell a user that declaring is the more accurate choice; it is not,
on a pattern with plenty of reflections.** What declaring buys is the retained
channels and a *measured* intruder (area and position with esds) instead of a
masked one. The balance tips toward declaring as the reflection count falls —
a low-symmetry phase, a narrow range, or a series whose trajectory needs every
reflection at every point — and that is the case to recommend it for.
(Measured: WP-1103, SRM 660c.)

**And read `EXTRA_PEAK_ON_REFLECTION` before quoting anything that overlaps.**
It fires whenever the declared component lands within 0.08° of a position the
model already predicts, which on the design case is *expected* — the intruder
really is on a sample peak. It is telling you the intensity split between phase
and component is a degeneracy, not a measurement: in the run above the recovered
component areas came back 1-2σ high because they had taken a little of the
reflection underneath. Quote the phase quantities and say the two overlap; never
quote the component's share as if the fit had resolved it.
(Measured: WP-1103.)

**8.24 An instrument profile does not carry a declared peak, even when the peak
really is the instrument's.** `save_instrument_profile` writes the widths, the
zero and the geometry and **drops `extra_components` entirely** — measured: an
`Instrument` with one `PeakComponent` saves and loads back with zero, while
`profile.w` survives unchanged. The stripping is deliberate for a
`HumpComponent`, which belongs to the specimen, but a holder or window line is
exactly the thing that *does* recur on the next sample, and it is dropped on the
same code path. **So in the calibrate to save to load to sample workflow, re-declare
the component on the sample's own instrument after `load_instrument_profile`;
nothing warns you.** Check `len(instrument.extra_components)` after the load if
you are driving that workflow unattended.
(Measured: WP-1103.)

**8.25 `vary=False` does not keep a parameter fixed, because a plan replaces
the vary flags rather than continuing them.** A stage's `turn_on` glob frees
whatever it matches, so a cell you pinned is refined by any plan carrying
`phases.*.cell.*` — measured on the shipped LaB6 over 2-30° 2θ: a cell declared
at 4.157597 Å comes back at 4.156826 Å, 185 ppm away, while
`structure.phases[0].cell.a.vary` still reads `False` and
`result.parameters` says `True`. The model you handed in and the result
contradict each other about the same parameter, and nothing fires.
**Say it with `Refinement.hold(globs)` instead**, which outranks the glob,
survives a save and reopen, and makes the stage report what it could not free
(§7 `HOLD_BLOCKED_PLAN`). This is the failure mode of
calibrate-on-a-certified-standard: holding the certificate's cell is what
decorrelates zero, displacement and cell, so a plan that frees it leaves a
calibration that is worthless and looks clean.
(Measured: WP-1435, issue #211.)

**8.26 A goodness of fit of 5 to 10 on a visually excellent refinement is
often correct, and "fixing" it means discarding the σ column the instrument
earned.** Most constant-wavelength neutron data is monitor-normalised with the
error propagated, so the file's σ is smaller than √y. On the ILL D1B pattern
this comes from, the median σ/√y is 0.289: the data are 3.46× more precise
than Poisson-of-y, GoF is the ratio of the residual to *that* σ, and a GoF
near 1 there would mean the fit was reproducing counting noise it cannot see.
Rwp is unaffected, because every weighted residual in the package divides by
the same σ. Do not substitute √y, and do not read the number against the
1.0-1.3 band that a σ = √y X-ray pattern earns.
**What this does break is anything that put a bar in σ.** A peak finder's
"5σ above background" is thresholding the background model's own tracking
error. That error is a fraction of the intensity and does not shrink when the
counting improves. On such a file the finder reads it at 3.46× its honest
significance. Measured over the 27 bundled pattern fixtures, by scaling the
declared σ alone and leaving the data untouched: the sampling measurement
behind §7 `PATTERN_UNDERSAMPLED` moved by a median factor of 5.45 and up to
78×, and every fixture landed at 1.5-2.5 steps per FWHM at the D1B ratio, i.e.
the warning fired on all of them. Both peak selections take a floor in the
pattern's own dynamic range beside the σ floor now, and the median factor is
1.000. A threshold in σ answers "is this significant". It answers nothing
about whether a feature is real.

**8.27 A contamination flag on a single line is a coincidence, and until
v1.6 the screen reported one per line.** Whether Kβ reaches the detector is a
property of the optics, so a leak puts a line at the predicted position of
*every* strong reflection, all at one ratio. Reading each match on its own
cannot tell that from an accident of the pattern, and did not: over the
seventeen bundled patterns — the sixteen IUCr round-robin phases and SRM
660c — every one collected behind a graphite monochromator that removes both
Kβ and W Lα, the old rule flagged 0.94 Kβ per
pattern against a control fed made-up wavelengths that flagged 1.01. Each flag
dropped a real reflection from `usable()`. The screen is now joint and those
corpora report nothing, while a Kβ image injected at 10 % of its parent is
found with its ratio on all six hosts tried. **Two consequences for an agent.**
Read `ContaminationFlag.leak_ratio`, the ratio fitted across the supporting
parents, rather than a single line's `intensity_ratio`. And read the detection
floor honestly: a leak under about 10 % comes back as nothing, and how far
under depends on how many peaks the pattern yields — zincite is caught at 1 %,
magnetite at 22 usable peaks not until 10 %. So an empty `contamination` list
means "no leak this rule can see" and never "the beam is clean". An unfiltered
tube sits at 0.14 (Hölzer et al. 1997), which is the case worth catching.

**8.28 A glob that matches nothing is normal, and a literal path that matches
nothing is a typo.** Plans reach components a model may not declare, so a
stage carrying `phases.*.microstrain.dof.*` on a model without a Stephens block
frees nothing and is healthy. A path with no `*`, `?` or `[` names one
parameter, though, and when the model has no such row the stage frees nothing,
converges, and until v1.6 said nothing: `instrument.source.wavelength` for
`instrument.source.lines.0.wavelength` is the measured case. That now fires
§7 `STAGE_PATH_UNKNOWN` with the nearest real path. **A typo inside a glob
(`phases.*.cel.*`) still cannot be told from a healthy miss, so read
`StageResult.freed` for every stage you wrote yourself.** On a joint fit the
same miss can hit one histogram only: `instrument.profile.*` freed the
constant-wavelength histogram and nothing on the fork's time-of-flight banks,
and the fit converged at Rwp 0.115 against 0.066 with the right globs. That is
§7 `STAGE_FREED_NOTHING`.
